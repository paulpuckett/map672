<h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
<p>Regarding where I find myself between cartographer, coder, and critic, I suppose it's a little bit of all three. As current mapping platforms include computers at some level, you must have at least some command of the interface in order to produce any map: pretty or ugly, informative or uninformative, exploitive or no. Being accomplished at the first two, however, may allow for a more competent execution of the third. Via your NMP colloquium, you noted a criticism that remarked, at least to my memory, that all of this NMP education was just to produce a choropleth or point map?  My argument would be that in order to express yourself musically, you must learn about music and your instrument before you're able to accurately express yourself or the piece you're trying to play. In the same way, learning cartography and coding allows one to create the maps that accurately express what you're trying to convey. As for whether that expression is honest or true, I'll leave that to the philosophers.</p>
<p>As for priorities, I just want to accumulate and hone skills. I come from a CADD (Computer Aided Design and Drafting) background rather than a GIS/coding background so I'm learning a lot of new things. My first priority is to try and become as confident with new mapping technologies as I am with things like AutoCAD. Comparing the two may be apples and oranges but there are at least some overlap, in my experience.</p>
<p>Concerning which aspects of the manifesto may be provocative or problematic, I would point to an excess of discussion regarding philosophies. This doesn't necessarily apply to the manifesto, but to the practice of cartogrpahy and geography in general. I understand there are different viewpoints in regards to how maps are produced, by whom, and with what intentions, but I'm focused on the production itself.  Without a map, there isn't much to discuss. I know there is ample room for argument regarding the thoughtful use of maps, as there is with statistics, or any other representation of data.  I just don't know that I'm the one to argue ontological, pedagogical, or epistemological theories.  I just want to be able to make the map I want, in the manner I wish to make it.</p>
